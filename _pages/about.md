Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lorenzo and I am a PhD student in the Computer Systems & Bioinformatics Laboratory at Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, passionate about <b>Generative Deep Models</b> and <b>Interpretability</b>.

<b> My aim is to change the way the clinicians search and discover medical knowledge from unstructured medical data. </b>

I received a bachelorâ€™s degree in Industrial Engineering in 2017 and a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering in 2020 both at Campus Bio-Medico of Rome.
I am based in the wonderful Pontina Plain in Italy spending my days with an amazing Research Team in <a href='http://www.cosbi-lab.it'>CoSBi</a> Laboratory.
